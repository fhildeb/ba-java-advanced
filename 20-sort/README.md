# Sort (Main)

This program features two search algorithms for finding a number within an array: sequential and binary searches. Within the sequential search for unordered arrays, various scenarios are implemented to prevent the array from being out of bounds. The binary search algorithm is better suited for ordered arrays and more more efficient due to its logarithmic time complexity. The program implements both recursive and iterative versions of the binary search and compares their runtime behavior on ordered number arrays.
