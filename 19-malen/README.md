# Malen (Main)

This program is a painting application that allows users to draw with their mouse, choose colors, clear the canvas, and save or load their drawings. The program utilizes a serializable class called StorageLine to represent each line segment and stores them in an ArrayList. By serializing and deserializing this ArrayList, users can save their drawings to a file or load them back for further editing. The application provides a user interface with buttons for each action, such as saving, loading, clearing the canvas, and exiting the program.
