# BinomialKoeffizient (Main)

This program demonstrates how to use a stack to convert a recursive problem into an iterative one. It focuses on calculating binomial coefficients using a problem stack, where the initial problem is broken down into directly solvable subproblems. The program implements a class with two integer attributes and a method to compute the binomial coefficient iteratively using a problem stack.

## Terminal Output

```bash
-> (5|3)
-> (4|3)-> (4|2)
-> (3|3)-> (3|2)-> (4|2)
-> (3|2)-> (4|2)
-> (2|2)-> (2|1)-> (4|2)
-> (2|1)-> (4|2)
-> (1|1)-> (1|0)-> (4|2)
-> (1|0)-> (4|2)
-> (4|2)
-> (3|2)-> (3|1)
-> (2|2)-> (2|1)-> (3|1)
-> (2|1)-> (3|1)
-> (1|1)-> (1|0)-> (3|1)
-> (1|0)-> (3|1)
-> (3|1)
-> (2|1)-> (2|0)
-> (1|1)-> (1|0)-> (2|0)
-> (1|0)-> (2|0)
-> (2|0)
(5|3) = 10

# SimpleList (Main)

This program implements a SimpleList class as the base data structure. The SimpleList class provides methods to create an empty list, insert and delete elements at the beginning, check if the list is empty, and clear the list. It also includes a method for a string representation of the list.

## Terminal Output

```bash
-> 1337-> 24-> 25
1337
24
false
true
```
