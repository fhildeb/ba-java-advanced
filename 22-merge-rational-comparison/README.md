# MergeSort (Main)

This program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting method. It works by dividing an array into two halves, sorting them individually, and then merging the sorted halves into a single, sorted array.

## Terminal Output

```bash
Given Array
2/5 9/2 5/5 6/8 89/72 7/5 23/12 5/2 1/2 12/2 2/7 4/2

Sorted array
2/5 6/8 1/2 2/7 5/5 89/72 7/5 23/12 5/2 4/2 9/2 12/2
```

# Rational (Main)

This program extends the Rational class, which represents rational numbers, by implementing the Comparable interface. The comparing methods provide a natural size comparison between rational numbers, enabling the comparison and sorting of Rational objects using standard sorting algorithms that rely on the Comparable interface.

## Terminal Output

```bash
1
```
