# GGTTester (Main)

This program calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The main class contains a method that takes the two input numbers and computes the GCD. In contrast, the second class serves as a tester, which extracts the first two command-line arguments, converts them into long values, and invokes the GCD computation method. It then displays the result. The program handles any exceptions that may arise during the execution and requires a runtime configuration for testing.

## Terminal Output
