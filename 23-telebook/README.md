# Telefonbuch (Main)

This program creates a simple phonebook that allows users to store multiple phone numbers for each subscriber. It provides functionalities for adding and removing phone numbers for a subscriber and removing the subscriber entirely from the phonebook. The program utilizes HashMap and HashSet for implementing the Map and Set interfaces, respectively.

## Terminal

```bash
{heinz=[0174], Otto=[1234, 0174]}
[1234, 0174]
```
