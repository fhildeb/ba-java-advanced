# XORCrypt (Main)

This program implements XOR encryption, where the plaintext is encrypted using a keyword. The plaintext and the keyword are bitwise XOR-encrypted, resulting in a ciphertext. The program provides methods to both encrypt and decrypt the message. Additionally, the program can read any file and encrypt it byte by byte using the XOR encryption method.
