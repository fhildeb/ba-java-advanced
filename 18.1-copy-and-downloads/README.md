# TesterCopy (Main)

This program demonstrates file manipulation using Java NIO.2, specifically working with the Path interface and the Files class. It provides functionality to copy a file within the same directory, move a file to another directory, and download and copy a file from a web server using a URL. The program ensures that existing files are replaced during the copy operation and creates the target directory if it does not already exist.

## Terminal Output

```bash
Datei kopiert.
URL kopiert.
```
