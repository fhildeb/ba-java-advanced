## Course Content

This advanced Java software course went deep into Java programming, focusing on file handling, algorithms, data structures, and the Java Collection Framework. One of the initial contents featured exploring the stream concept and various input and output methods, including object serialization. We also learned about algorithm efficiency and the O notation and delved into complexity classes. The course thoroughly covered search algorithms, sorting techniques, and hashing procedures, providing a comprehensive understanding of Java's data manipulation capabilities. Therefore, data structures like lists, queues, stacks, and associative memory were necessary to incorporate. The knowledge was applied to a variety of projects. The different scopes of the course can be seen in this feature list:

- Stream Concept in Java
- File Handling and Directory Access
- Character-wise and Bytewise I/O
- Object (De)-Serialization
- Algorithm efficiency and O Notation
- Complexity classes
- Search and Sorting Algorithms
- Hashtables and HashMaps
- Java Collection Framework
- Generics and Parametric Data Types
- Hashing Procedures and Collections
- Simple Dynamic Data Structures
- Linear Concatenated Lists and Stacks
- Single and Double Linked Lists
- Binary Search Trees
- Queues and Priority-based Queues
- Undirected and directed Graph Search Algorithms
- Breadth-first and Depth-first Search
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
