# DateiLesen (Main)

This program demonstrates using RandomAccessFile in Java to read and write numbers to a file. It consists of a test class that creates a RandomAccessFile for reading and writing and writes the squares of integers from 0 to 100 into the file. After writing the numbers, the program resets the file pointer to the beginning and reads back all the written numbers, displaying them in the terminal.

## Terminal Output

```bash
1
4
9
16
25
36
...
2500
```
